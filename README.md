**⭐ BUSINESS COMMUNICATION**

**Situation:**
When I started the Work Readiness training, I realised that my communication style was too casual for a professional setting. My emails were short, lacked structure, and sometimes sounded abrupt.

**Task:**
I needed to learn how to communicate professionally — including writing formal emails, giving clear instructions, and adapting tone depending on the audience.

**Action:**
I studied professional email examples, learned the correct structure (greeting → purpose → detail → closing), practised rewriting my informal messages, and participated in communication activities during training. I also used feedback to improve clarity and tone.

**Result:**
My communication became more professional, structured, and confident. I am now able to write workplace-ready emails, communicate clearly in different situations, and maintain a professional tone across all platforms.

**⭐ INTERVIEW SKILLS**

**Situation:**
During career preparation sessions, I struggled to answer behavioural questions like “Tell me about a time you solved a problem.” My answers lacked structure and I would often forget important details.

**Task:**
I needed to learn a reliable method to answer interview questions confidently, clearly, and with relevant examples.

**Action:**
I practiced the STAR (Situation, Task, Action, Result) method using sample questions. I researched common interview questions, prepared my own examples, and practised speaking out loud. I also got feedback on how to improve eye contact and tone.

**Result:**
I now feel more prepared for real interviews. My answers are more structured and demonstrate my abilities clearly. The STAR method helped me become more confident, organised, and professional in interview settings.

**⭐ MOCK INTERVIEW**

**Situation:**
During the mock interview session, I felt nervous and struggled with confidence. The questions felt challenging, and I was worried about giving the wrong answers.

**Task:**
I needed to manage my nerves, answer questions professionally, and use the mock interview as practice for real-world job opportunities.

**Action:**
I took a deep breath before each question, listened carefully, and used the STAR method to guide my responses. I maintained eye contact, sat upright, and spoke clearly. After the interview, I reviewed the feedback to identify areas for improvement.

**Result:**
By the end of the session, my confidence improved significantly. I learned how to handle pressure, communicate calmly, and present myself like a professional. The mock interview prepared me for real job interviews and helped me understand my strengths and weaknesses.

**⭐PROFESSIONAL NETWORKING**

**Situation:**
Before the training, I had very few professional contacts and limited understanding of how networking works or why it matters.

**Task:**
I needed to build a professional online presence, connect with people in the ICT field, and learn how to communicate professionally on platforms like LinkedIn.

**Action:**
I created and updated my LinkedIn profile with a headline, summary, education, skills, and projects. I connected with classmates, lecturers, and professionals. I also engaged with ICT-related posts and joined groups to stay informed.

**Result:**
My LinkedIn network grew, and I became more confident interacting with industry professionals. I now understand how networking creates opportunities, builds reputation, and increases visibility in the job market.


**⭐ WORKPLACE ETIQUETTE**

**Situation:**
I realised that I didn’t fully understand all aspects of workplace etiquette — especially things like meeting behaviour, professional dress code, and workplace communication norms.

**Task:**
I needed to learn how to behave professionally in different workplace environments, including how to interact with colleagues, attend meetings, and maintain professionalism at all times.

**Action:**
I completed the workplace etiquette training modules, took notes, and participated in discussions about punctuality, respect, teamwork, communication, and conflict management. I also applied these principles in group work and classroom activities.

**Result:**
I gained confidence in presenting myself professionally. I now understand appropriate behaviour in a workplace, how to communicate respectfully, and how to maintain professionalism in different scenarios.
